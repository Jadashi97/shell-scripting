FILE PERMISSIONS 

Unix is a multi user system
Every file and directory in the account can be protected

N  Description              ls              binary 
0  No permissions           ---              000
1  Ony execute              --x              001
2  Only write               -w-              010
3  write and execute        -wx              011
4  Only read                r--              100
5  Read and excute          r-x              101
6  Read and Write           rw-              110
7  Read,write and execute   rwx              111

3 Main types of permissions

"r"  -read
"w"  -Write
"x"  - excute


Each permission can be controlled at 3 diff levels

"u"  - user  => yourself
"g"  - group => coworkers
"o"  - other => other everyone else in the system

Example;
-rw-r--r--  ! dfi303 staff 6049 Mar 9 2020 VOLTAGE.sql

"-" => since it doesnt start with "l" or "d", this mean it is a file
"rw" => [u] this means the user has read and write access
"r-" => [g] means group had read on to this file
"r- " => [o] means others have only
